CNN-OBJECTCLASSIFICATION-CIFAR10

In this activity, we have to implement the classification problem on cifar10 dataset with three different models architecture. The baseline model was given and I implement the baseline_model2 according to instructions given in the file. Furthermore, I build my own model architecture with different parameter configuration. After that I plot the model error, confusion matrix and accuracy to show the difference between these three models. 
Custom model accuracy is higher than all the other models, its 82.24 %. So the custom model is working well than the other models.
